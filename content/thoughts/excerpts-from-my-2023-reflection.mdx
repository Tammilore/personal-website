"The worst part, at least for me, was it was difficult to separate the lack of motivation from other aspects of my life. It spread like a plague. I found it hard to do other things. I didn't write as much as I would have liked. I didn’t build a lot of side projects for fun. I was just stuck. I had to continuously fight to hold on to some motivation, whether I watched films or cartoons that made me feel something but the sad thing is that it was usually in short bursts. You can say I was losing my spark and that is one of my worst nightmares come true. The others include a car accident on the Third Mainland Bridge, sleep paralysis with an actual monster and a couple of other stuff."

"I put off calling it a startup for as long as I could, I truly believed making it official like that would turn it into something I wasn’t sure I was ready to deal with but eventually I tagged it as one. Zing went through different phases and for all of it, I was a one-man team. I did everything from my sorry attempt at sales to product development, documentation, building the APIs and dashboard, scheduling demos, crying in frustration and going weeks at a stretch pacing like a mad woman scribbling on my whiteboard or sleeping in one corner on the floor with my head blank."

"I’m generally really hard on myself, I prefer it that way because most people aren’t really hard on you. They’ll tell you you’re okay or doing well enough and that you shouldn’t stress it too much but they say that probably because they care about you and don’t want you to hurt yourself. You probably say it to other people too. But you shouldn’t believe them or at least I don’t. Because if I have even the slightest chance of being what I want to be and where I want to be, I cannot be complacent."
