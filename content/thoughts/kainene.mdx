I can't remember when I first watched Half of a Yellow Sun, should be over 5 years now but once in a while I think about what could have happened to Kainene.

Weirdly, an end where I knew for a fact that she was dead would have been more relieving but I guess the point was for us to make up our own dreadful ending? So I imagine that maybe she died or got captured but mostly I imagine an end where she's just stuck somewhere unable to make her way back.

I know that part is just fiction in the movie but I can't stop thinking about how sad it is.
