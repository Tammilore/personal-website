I'm one of those people who think Spotify's recommendation is on point. You play a song and more cool jams follow. Well, at least most times. The tiny problem I had was needing to add them to a playlist and having to leave whatever I was doing even for a second so I could click "Add song to playlist" so I created **Autolist**.

Autolist allows you automate creating playlists and adding songs to that playlist. It's built to be pretty straight forward, here's a recorded demo to show you how it works.
