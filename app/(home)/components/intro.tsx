      I&apos;m the CPO at <Link href="/work/corellium">Corellium</Link> â€” a
      virtual hardware platform for government agencies and large enterprises to
      perform security research, penetration testing and development on mobile
      and IoT devices. I run the product management, customer support and design
      teams.

    <p>
      I have limited availability and occasionally take on freelance projects
      and consulting. I&apos;m also open to joining boards and advisory roles.

      Also, I have a private mailing list where I keep 1000+ people up to date
      with what I&apos;m working on. Feel free to join if you&apos;re
      interested.
