      <p>Hi, I&apos;m Hayden Bleasel.</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m the CPO at <Link href="/work/corellium">Corellium</Link> â€” a
        virtual hardware platform for government agencies and large enterprises
        to perform security research, penetration testing and development on
        mobile and IoT devices. I run the product management, customer support
        and design teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I ran an agency called{' '}
        <Link href="/work/jellypepper">Jellypepper</Link>. We worked with
        startups in self-driving car tech, AI, biotech, crypto, drone delivery,
        cybersecurity and even orbital (outer space) logistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have limited availability and occasionally take on freelance projects
        and consulting. I&apos;m also open to joining boards and advisory roles.
        If you&apos;re interested, please get in touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I have a private mailing list where I keep 1000+ people up to date
        with what I&apos;m working on. Feel free to join if you&apos;re
        interested.
      </p>
