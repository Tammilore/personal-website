# Daylight

My personal website. Itâ€™s built from ground-up with my favourite technologies, starting with Next.js and Vercel for the construct, then Tailwind for utility classes for rapid development.

## Installation

Download the repository and install the dependencies with:

```sh
yarn install
```

Create an `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
RESEND_TOKEN=""
GITHUB_TOKEN=""
```

Then run the local development server with:

```sh
yarn dev
```
